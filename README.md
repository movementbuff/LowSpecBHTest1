Basic Performance Configs 1920x1080

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure you download the files from the branch that corresponds to your resolution. There are two branches, 1920x1080 and 1920x810.
If you prefer to use a different resolution you simply need to open the files in Notepad and Find and Replace all instances of the values "1920" and "1080" with whichever resolution values you prefer.
Alternatively, you should be able to change to your preferred resolution in-game, however you will need to do this every time after launching Bloodhunt.

- First, Press Windows Key + R and type %localappdata%\Tiger\ then press enter.
  
- Copy and Backup the folder "Settings" to somewhere memorable.
- Open the folder "Saved" then "Config" and copy the "WindowsNoEditor" folder, placing it with the other Settings backup.
- Leave your backups alone unless you seek to restore your previous settings. 

- Inside WindowsNoEditor folder ( %localappdata%\Tiger\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor ) replace your current "Engine.ini" ,  "DeviceProfiles.ini" and "GameUserSettings.ini" with the files you downloaded.
- After replacing, Right click each file and Select "Properties". Ensure that "Read Only" is ticked/enabled.
  
- Return to the Tiger folder ( %localappdata%\Tiger\ ) and open the "Settings" folder, then replace "DisplaySettings.json" and "GraphicsSettings.json".
- Perform the same check as early to validate that Read Only is enabled on both files.

- Finally, Use RTSS to cap Frame Rate at 120, 125, 144, 165, 180, 200 or use the in-game Frame Limiter to prevent the framerate from spiking and dipping  (RTSS is strongly preferred. It is free and simple to use)
  I recommend testing each Frame Rate cap over several matches until you can decide on which is the most consistent during fights.
